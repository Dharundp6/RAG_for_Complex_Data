RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Complex Financial Data Analysis
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a powerful framework that combines the LLaMA (Large Language Model Augmented) with external financial data sources and Groq inferencing to enhance the analysis of complex datasets. It leverages the strength of large language models in understanding and generating natural language while augmenting their capabilities with retrieval from domain-specific knowledge bases and efficient hardware acceleration.
Features

Data Ingestion: RAG supports ingesting various financial data sources, including structured databases, unstructured text documents (e.g., reports, news articles), and semi-structured data like HTML tables.
Knowledge Base Construction: Builds domain-specific knowledge bases from ingested data using advanced information retrieval and natural language processing techniques. This includes entity extraction, relation extraction, and document indexing.
LLaMA Integration: Incorporates the LLaMA (Large Language Model Augmented) for powerful language understanding and generation capabilities. LLaMA is a state-of-the-art large language model pre-trained on massive textual corpora.
Retrieval-Augmented Language Model: Combines LLaMA with a retrieval component that can access the constructed knowledge base. This allows the model to generate outputs informed by both its pre-training and the relevant external data.
Groq Inferencing: Utilizes Groq's high-performance tensor processing units (TPUs) to accelerate the inferencing process, enabling real-time analysis of large financial datasets.
Query Understanding: Employs natural language understanding techniques to interpret user queries, extract relevant entities, and formulate appropriate queries to the knowledge base.
Contextual Generation: Generates contextual and data-driven responses to user queries by conditioning LLaMA on both the query and the retrieved relevant information from the knowledge base.
Multi-Modal Analysis: Supports analysis of multi-modal data, such as financial reports with text and tables, by jointly encoding and reasoning over different modalities.
Interactive Analysis: Enables interactive exploration of financial data through a conversational interface, where users can ask follow-up questions and receive contextual responses based on the retrieved information.
Explainability: Provides explainability mechanisms to understand the model's reasoning and the evidence retrieved from the knowledge base that influenced the generated outputs.
